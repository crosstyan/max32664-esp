# Measuring SpO2 and Heart Rate Using the MAX32664C - A Quick Start Guide

## Abstract

The MAX32664C is a variant of the MAX32664 sensor-hub family, which is specifically targeted for measurement of SpO2 and heart rate. Combined with the MAX86141/MAXM86161 optical sensor and a 3-axis accelerometer, it provides the sensor's raw data, as well as calculated SpO2 and heart-rate data, to a host device through its I2C slave interface. This document provides step-by-step instructions that enable a user to communicate with the MAX32664C and to calibrate, configure, and receive measurement and monitoring data.

## Introduction

The MAX32664C is a variant of the MAX32664 sensor-hub family that enables users to capture raw data, as well as calculated SpO2  and heart-rate data. The firmware includes the drivers and algorithm that are required to interface with a sensor device, such as the MAX86141, through the SPI port, or the MAXM86161 through first I2C port as master. The second I2C interface is slave and dedicated to establishing communication with a host microcontroller.

In order to properly capture and calculate the data, this solution requires an accelerometer. The MAX32664C firmware includes the required drivers for the Kionix Â®  KX122 accelerometer, which is  wired  together  with  the  sensor  to  the  same  SPI  or  I2C  port.  Alternatively,  a  host-side accelerometer can be used. In this case, the sampled accelerometer data must be periodically reported  to  the  MAX32664C  by  the  host  microcontroller  using  commands  described  in  this application note.

This document provides the instructions necessary to create a solution with the MAX32664C based on the MAXREFDES102# reference design.

NOTE: The instructions in this document are compatible with the MAX32664C firmware version 30.9.x (MAX86141), or 32.9.x (MAXM86161) and later. If you are using older firmware, make sure to upgrade the firmware.

## 1 Architecture

A  typical  health-sensing  design  includes  a  host  microcontroller  that  communicates  with  the MAX32664C through the I2C bus. Two GPIO pins are needed to control the reset and the startup in Application or Bootloader mode through the RSTN and multifunction input/output (MFIO) pins.

To enter Bootloader mode:

- Set the RSTN pin to low for 10ms.
- While RSTN is low, set the MFIO pin to low. (The MFIO pin should be set to low at least 1ms before the RSTN pin is set to high.)
- After the 10ms has elapsed, set the RSTN pin to high.
- After an additional 50ms has elapsed, the MAX32664 is in Bootloader mode.

To enter Application mode:

- Set the RSTN pin to low for 10ms.
- While RSTN is low, set the MFIO pin to high.
- After the 10ms has elapsed, set the RSTN pin to high. (The MFIO pin should be set to high at least 1ms before the RSTN pin is set to high.)
- After  an  additional  50ms  has  elapsed,  the  MAX32664  is  in  Application  mode  and  the application performs its initialization of the application software.
- After approximately 1 second from when the RSTN pin was set to high, the application completes the initialization and the device is ready to accept I2C commands.

The MFIO pin (normally set to high) is used in Application mode to wake up the MAX32664C from its Deep Sleep mode prior to any I2C communication. The MAX32664C interfaces to the optical sensor through either the SPI bus (such as the MAX86141), or I2C bus (such as the MAXM86161), subject to firmware support of the sensor.

An  accelerometer  is  mandatory  for  heart-rate  monitoring.  A  KX122  accelerometer  can  be connected directly to the MAX32664C. The interrupt line of the accelerometer is recommended to be connected to the MAX32664C to support motion detection power saving. Alternatively, an external 3-axis host-side accelerometer can be used. In this case, the host needs to periodically provide  accelerometer  readings  to  the  sensor  hub  using  the  commands  provided  in  this document. For more information, see the MAX32664 User Guide .

The optical sensor utilizes green and/or red and infrared (IR) LEDs to transmit pulses and one or more photodiodes (PD) to collect reflected or residual light. By default, the heart-rate monitoring algorithm uses a green LED (LED1) and two PDs (PD1 and PD2). The SpO2 employs one IR LED (LED2) and one red LED (LED3) with one PD (PD1).

Note:  If  a  configuration  other  than  default  is  used,  the  user  should  change  the  LED  and  PD configuration for heart-rate and SpO2  algorithms using the provided commands (see Table 11 ) prior to enabling the algorithm.

## 1.1 Communicating with the MAX32664C

A  host  uses  the  I2C  bus  to  communicate  with  the  MAX32664C  (slave)  using  a  series  of commands. A generic write command includes the following fields:

Slave\_WriteAddress(1 byte)|Command\_Family(1 byte)|Command\_Index(1 byte)|Value(multiple bytes)

A generic response includes the following fields:

Slave\_ReadAddress(1 byte)|Status(1 byte)|Value (multiple bytes)

Slave\_WriteAddress and Slave\_ReadAddress are set to 0xAA and 0xAB, respectively.

The read status byte is an indicator of success (0x00) or failure, as shown in Table 1 .

| STATUS BYTE  VALUE | DESCRIPTION                                                                   |

| 0xFE               | Device is busy. Try again.                                                    |
| 0xFF               | Unknown error.                                                                |

Normally, when MAX32664C is idle, it switches to Deep Sleep mode to save power. An external interrupt-like sensor, host MFIO, or RTC alarm forces the MAX32664C to wake up.

In particular, the host is required to wake up the MAX32664C prior to any I2C communication by:

- Â· Setting the MFIO pin to low at least 250 Î¼ s before the beginning of an I2C transaction to make sure the MAX32664C is awake.
- Â· Keeping the MFIO pin low during the I2C transaction to make sure the MAX32664C will not switch to Deep Sleep mode.
- Â· Setting  MFIO to high after the end of I2C  communication to allow the MAX32664C to switch back to Deep Sleep mode.

This  document  provides  examples  of  commands  for  establishing  communication  with  the MAX32664C. For a complete list of commands and instructions for the I2C interface, see the MAX32664 User Guide .

## 1.2 Power-Saving Considerations

## 1.2.1 Report Rate

The  MAX32664C  goes  into  deep  sleep  in  Idle  mode  and  wakes  up  on  internal  or  external interrupts. To maximize the benefits of low power, the host may configure the report period of the algorithm to a longer time. In this case, the report is generated less frequently.

This report rate is configured through an I2C command, as shown in Table 12 .

## 1.2.2 Polling Period

The host is required to regularly poll the MAX32664C to read available measurement data. The polling period depends on the rate that the MAX32664C report is generated. By reducing the report  period,  polling  is  needed  less  often  and  hence  the  number  of  wake-up  events  will  be reduced significantly.

The polling period can be set four to five times the length of the report period to avoid FIFO overflow. In this case, several samples will be read in each polling.

By default, the report rate is set to one per sample, which translates to 40ms. In this case, a 200ms polling period is suggested.

## 1.2.3 Report Content

If  the  sensor  data  such  as  accelerometer  and  photoplethysmogram  (PPG)  signals  are  not required, the host may  choose  to  request  only  algorithm data. This reduces  the I2C communication time and affects power consumption. This is performed by configuring the output mode to Algorithm Only.

This output mode is configured through an I2C command, as shown in Table 12 .

## 1.3 Accelerometer

The MAX32664C requires accelerometer data to function properly. In particular, an accelerometer is mandatory for a heart-rate monitor to be able to compensate for the user's motion. Otherwise, the reported heart rate will not be correct during movement.

SpO2 calculation requires a resting condition, and the algorithm uses accelerometer data to detect excessive motion. In such a condition, computation is paused, and the user is informed with a motion flag.

A sensor hub accelerometer can be integrated through the SPI port of the MAX32664C. In this case,  the  required  driver  for  KX122  is  already  included.  The  user  only  needs  to  follow  the reference schematics to connect the accelerometer and enable it before starting the algorithm, as described later in this document. Normally, the accelerometer is polled to collect samples. The interrupt line is only needed if the SCD-based power saving procedure is implemented in the host.

Alternatively, a host-side accelerometer can be used. However, this option requires strict timing synchronization between the sampled accelerometer data and PPG samples of Â±40ms or less. In order to use the host-side accelerometer:

- 1. The host should start the accelerometer just before enabling the algorithm to maximize the  initial  synchronization  between  the  PPG  and  accelerometer  samples.  However, accelerometer  samples  collected  prior  to  receiving  the  confirmation  of  the  algorithm enable I2C command should be discarded.
- 2. The host is required to use a 3-axis accelerometer at a 25Hz sampling rate. If a higher sampling rate is chosen, samples should be decimated to be synchronized with a 40ms PPG sampling time.
- 3. The host must queue five accelerometer samples and feed them at the same time to the MAX32664C using the  commands  shown  in Table  2 .  The  period  of  feeding  samples should be 200ms. This is the longest delay that the MAX32664C can tolerate to receive accelerometer samples.

Because the sensor and the host accelerometer use different clock sources, exact synchronization  between  them  is  not  possible.  The  MAX32664C  internally  decimates  or interpolates accelerometer samples as needed to compensate a drift.

## 2 SpO2 Calibration

Due  to  variations  in  the  physical  design  and  optical  shield  of  the  final  product,  a  calibration procedure for SpO2  is required to be performed once in a controlled environment. This procedure is important to ensure the quality of the SpO2  calculation. This step is typically performed in a standard lab with a reference SpO2  device to determine three calibration coefficients: a, b, and c. The details of the calibration procedure are described in the Guidelines for SpO2 Measurement Using the Maxim MAX32664 Sensor Hub application note.

Once three calibrations coefficients are obtained, they need to be loaded to the MAX32664C every time prior to starting the algorithm. But first, they are required to be converted to a 32-bit integer format using the following:

- Â· Aint32  = round (10 5  x a)
- Â· Bint32  = round (10 5  x b)
- Â· Cint32  = round (10 5  x c)

For example, the default measured calibration coefficients are:

- Â· a = -16.666666
- Â· b = 8.333333
- Â· c = 100

They are sent to the MAX32664C in integer format after conversion:

- Â· Aint32  = round (10 5  x a) = 0xFFE69196
- Â· Bint32  = round (10 5  x b) = 0x000CB735
- Â· Cint32  = round (10 5  x c) = 0x00989680

The  calibration  coefficients  may  be  stored  in  the  host  flash  separately  and  loaded  to  the MAX32664C after every reset.

Table 3 shows the sequence of commands for the calibration process. Table 4 shows the format of received samples. Typically, R values are needed for the calibration process, as described in the Guidelines for SpO2 Measurement Using the Maxim MAX32664 Sensor Hub application note.

*The host is required to poll the MAX32664C for an available report. A report is available per every sensor sample. Since the effective sample rate is 25Hz, this means the report will be ready every 40ms. Depending on the output mode, the report may include algorithm and/or sensor data (see section 1.2 and Table 12 ).

## 3.1 Raw Data Collection Mode

For hardware testing purposes, the user may choose to start the MAX32664C to collect raw PPG samples.  In  this  case,  the  host  configures  the  MAX32664C  to  work  in  Raw  Data  mode  (no algorithm) by enabling the accelerometer and the AFE. Table 5 lists the set of commands that are needed to work in this mode. In Raw Data mode, only raw PPG samples and accelerometer data are included in the received samples.

## 3.2 AGC Mode

In this mode, the wearable algorithm suite (SpO2  and WHRM) is enabled and the R value, SpO2 , SpO2 confidence level, heart rate, heart-rate confidence level, RR value, and activity class are reported. Furthermore, automatic gain control (AGC) is enabled. Because AGC is a subset of AEC functionality, to enable AGC, AEC still needs to be enabled. However, automatic calculation of target PD should be turned off, and the desired level of AGC target PD current is set by the user. The user may change the algorithm to the desired configuration mode, as shown in Table 11 . If signal quality is low, a LowSNR flag will be set. Excessive motion is also reported with a flag. The sequence of commands is shown in Table 7 .

Following operation mode of the algorithm can be selected as described in Table 11 :

- 0. Continuous  HRM  +  Continuous  SpO2: Both heart-rate and  SpO2  values  are continuously measured and updated.
- 1. Continuous  HRM  +  One-Shot  SpO2: Heart  rate  is  continuously  monitored;  SpO2   is measured once.
- 2. Continuous HRM: Only the heart-rate algorithm in continuous mode is enabled.
- 3. Sampled HRM: It measures heart rate once using the sampled HRM algorithm and then switches to activity mode.
- 4. Sampled HRM + One-Shot SpO2: It measures heart rate and SpO2 , and then switches to activity mode.
- 5. Activity Tracking ONLY: Only shows accelerometer data. LEDs are off.
- 6. SpO2 Calibration: Used for SpO2  calibration. Only red and IR LEDs are activated, and R value is being measured and updated to be used in the calibration procedure.

## 3.4 Power-Saving Mode

This mode is similar to the previously described mode where the algorithm, AEC and SCD are enabled (by default). The only differences are to change the following in Table 10 :

- Â· Change the output mode in step 1.2 to Algorithm Only (0x02) as shown in Table 12 .
- Â· Change the report rate in step 1.4 to 25 (0x19) or more as shown in Table 12 .
- Â· Adjust the host polling period according to the report rate.
- Â· Choose the desired algorithm operation mode in step 1.7. The Sampled HRM mode saves more power as it automatically switches to Activity Tracking mode once the heart rate is measured. In this case, the host may choose to reconfigure the operation mode as needed (e.g., in case of motion).
- Â· Enable the WHRM and SpO2 algorithm in step 1.11 in normal report mode.

This configuration helps the MAX32664C to wake up less often, and I2C communication time is minimized. The report detailed in Table 8 will only include algorithm data.

Note:  This  mode  is  not  appropriate  for  monitoring  interbeat  interval  (RR)  value.  RR  and  RR Confidence are reported whenever a new value is calculated by the algorithm and shown as zero for the rest of the time. Therefore, the last reported value may be missed if the report rate is not set to 1.

## 4 Configurations and Settings

The settings shown in Table 11 are available for the wearable suite (SpO2  and WHRM) algorithm. To  update  the  algorithm  settings,  make  sure  to  send  the  appropriate  commands  BEFORE enabling the algorithm.

Table 12 lists a number of frequently used sensor hub settings and commands. For the full list, refer to the MAX32664 User Guide .

## 5 Using SCD State and Motion Detection for Power Saving

In order to further reduce power consumption when the device is not placed on the skin, a motiondetection-enabled state machine can be implemented in the host. In this case, the MAX32664C stays in sleep mode until a motion event is reported by the accelerometer, or an I2C command is received from the host. Figure 4 demonstrates an example of such a state machine.

- Active State: Normally, the MAX32664C runs in Active state in AEC mode ( section 3.3 ) or Power Saving mode ( section 3.4 ).  If  the  SCD state in the report shows off-skin for certain time, the state machine switches to Probing state.
- Probing State: In this state, the host periodically turns the algorithm on and off. If an OnSkin state is reported while the algorithm is running, it will switch back to Active state and continue running the algorithm. Otherwise, after several attempts of turning the algorithm on and off (the off period can be increased after each attempt), it will switch to Off-Skin state. In Active and Probing states, the procedure to start, read report, or stop are similar to the regular sequence described in Table 10 for AEC mode , or as highlighted for PowerSaving mode.
- Off-Skin  State : In  Off-Skin  state,  the  goal  is  to  save  more  power  by  allowing  the MAX32664C to stay in sleep mode, so long as there is no motion. Depending on the use of a host or sensor hub accelerometer ( section 1.3 ), the host is required to configure the MAX32664C differently, as shown in Figure 4.

If  the  KX122  is  connected  to  the  MAX32664C  as  the  sensor  hub  accelerometer,  the MAX32664C must be configured to wake up on motion. In this case, the accelerometer is enabled in the  interrupt  mode  and  the  motion  threshold  and  the  duration  of  motion  is configured using the wake up on motion configuration command, as shown in Table 13 . Note  that  the  interrupt  line  of  the  accelerometer  is  required  to  be  connected  to  the MAX32664C as shown in Figure 1 ,  to  support  this  feature.  Once  the  MAX32664C  is configured, the host should start only the accelerometer. As soon as a motion interrupt occurs, the MAX32664C will wake up and read accelerometer samples and store them in the sensor hub FIFO. The host should periodically read the MAX32664C FIFO to check if any accelerometer sample has been captured since the last polling period. If there is a sample, the host should switch to Active state by first disabling the wake up on motion configuration and then restarting the algorithm.

In case of using a host-side accelerometer, the implementation exclusively relies on the host. In this case, the host accelerometer should be configured to interrupt on a certain level of motion for certain duration. Refer to the data sheet of the desired accelerometer for such a setting. The host can stop the MAX32664C when going to this mode and restart it as motion is detected using the same procedure shown in Table 10.

## 6 Power Consumption Estimate

The MAX32664 sensor hub family runs in two distinct operating modes. The Active mode is the mode in which the execution of the firmware occurs. The Deep Sleep mode is enabled by the sensor hub to save power when the processor is idle or there is no need for any processing. It makes all internal clocks of the MAX32664 gated off. In this mode, only RTC is enabled as a source of backup for wakeup. As soon as a sensor interrupt is received, the MAX32664 wakes up,  completes  the  processing,  and  goes  back  to  sleep.  It  also  must  wake  up  prior  to  I2C communication by pulling MFIO low, as described in section 1.1 .

Table  8 and Table  15 show  the  power  consumption  in  each  mode.  To  estimate  the  power consumption while running the algorithm, the percentage of time that the MAX32664 is in Active mode is measured. For this measurement, the report interval is set to 1 second and only algorithm data is reported, as described in section 3.4 . The estimated power consumption for a selected number of algorithm operation modes is summarized in Table 16 .
